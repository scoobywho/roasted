Q:How would you add a DNS server to a network interface in Linux?
You would need to add it to the active interface, by editing the connection, so if the connection name is mycon on Centos7 you would edit the file below, 
# vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-mycon
and add the following entry,
DNS1=10.2.31.12


Q:If the DNS server you've just added is not reachable, how can you get any particular hostname to resolve locally?
Add a entry in the hosts file, with the IP and hostname that it should resolve to,
Path of the file in Centos7 
# vi /etc/hosts
Enter the IP follwed by hostname in the hosts file
10.2.30.10 example.com

Q:How would you check for SELinux related errors?
- When SELinux denies an action, an (AVC) message is logged to the /var/log/audit/audit.log and /var/log/messages
- Use the journalctl utility to view more information about the AVC message
# journalctl -t setroubleshoot --since= [time]
- Use the sealert utility to further inspect the AVC message
# sealert -l [message_ID

Q:Write the commands to add 30GB disk space to a logical volume named "docker" that belongs to a logical group named "docker-group".
Prepare the disk
To check the disks on the VM and the new disk that was added
# fdisk -l

Prepare the disk using the fidk utility
# fdisk /dev/sdb
n - new partition
p - primary partition
partition number - enter for 1
first sector - press enter for default
last sector - press enter for default

t and select 8e lvm
p to verify 
w to write changes

partprobe - run partprobe 

format the disk
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1

Create a PV with the new disk
# pvcreate /dev/sdb1

extend the volume group with the new disk
# vgextend docker-group /dev/sdb1

create LV 
# lvcreate -L {sizeG} -n docker-group docker

Create a file system on the new disk
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/docker-group-docker
